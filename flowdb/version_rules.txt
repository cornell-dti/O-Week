Notes on Version-based Feed:

1. WARNING on Deleted Objects:
The objects identified to have been deleted by the database, as identified by
their primary keys may not be locally stored on the device. For example, consider
a device running a version i of the app. The database is currently on version j,
where j >> i. An event could have been added to update the database to version k,
where j > k > i. This event could then be deleted to create version k' of the 
database, where j > k' > k > i. In this case, this event would not be
stored on the device but would be shown to have been deleted by the database. 

2. Grouping by 'changed' and 'deleted':
Instead of grouping objects of each type by the ones
modified, added and deleted post the most recent local version,
these objects are grouped by those that have been changed (added or modified)
or deleted.

The latter approach was not chosen because grouping events by these
categories would require effectively recreating the information
stored locally based on the version history present on the database. This would
be achieved by iterating through past version to recreate the current state
of data on the device. Doing this each time the device requests updated
data is extremely inefficient. Alternatively, this could be done by 
forcing the device running the app to send the primary keys of events 
it currently holds, which is unfeasible.

To enable the output json string to be used efficiently, I would
strongly suggest keepig the primary keys of categories and events
objects stored locally as metadata.
