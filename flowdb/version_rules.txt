WARNING on Deleted Objects:
#not nec. in the app at all

Grouping by 'changed' and 'deleted':
#alternative is to group by add, mod and del.
#in order to do this would have to either need existing
#pks from app, which is inefficient to provide in a request
#object or need to recreate this from the database
#(don't want to do this because we would always be doing
#additional work: say the url is used at version 12 and then 14,
#we would be recreating the history on the second call when it
#was already created at 12 and this is magnified by the number of users)

#instead the front-end can just be careful in using it the correct way
