API Changes:

1. Category objects shown in jSON objects have a new key, 
   'pk' added:
	{category : 'Logistics', 'description' : 'Test'}
						will now be
	{pk : 1, category : 'Logistics', 'description' : 'Test'}

2. Event objects shown in jSON have integer values for the
   key 'category' as opposed to using strings. The integers
   correspond to the primary key of the category they represent
   {pk : 2, name : "test" ... , category : 'Logistics', ...} 
						will now be
   {pk : 2, name : "test" ... , category : 1, ...} 			

3. Updates to any events are visible using the following url:
   https://oweekapp.herokuapp.com/flow/version/<local_version>
   where local_version is the version of the database stored on the device.

   a. The first time data is downloaded, use local_version = 0
   b. For downloading any event or category data, I'd suggest solely using this
      url. This is mainly because the other ones provided (eg: feed/<day>) give no
      indication of what updates should be present on the device and thus, could
      lead to inconsistent data.
   c. A sample jSON response is in the other document I've uploaded. 
   	  version_rules.txt delves into some more design choices, if you're curious.

   A summary of the jSON response:

   The response has 3 main keys: 'version', 'events', 'categories'. 

   'version' is the database's version and once the all the data in 
   the response is reflected in the device, the version the local 
   'database' will be in. 

   'events' is further divided into two key-value pairs: 'changed', 'deleted'.

   'deleted' is a list of integers that identifies the pks of the event objects deleted
   between local_version and the most recent version on the database. Importantly,
   it is entirely possible that an event object in this list many not be in the local 
   database at all.

   'changed' is a list of the events that have been added or modified. This is not a 
   list of pks but instead a list of event objects in jSON form.

   'categories' is similar to events but for category objects.

4. Everyone should be able to access the database using the following details:
   url: https://oweekapp.herokuapp.com/admin
   username: oweekadmin
   password: oweekapp

   Feel free to add to the Event Details Tables in case you need to test anything
   in particular. 

   CAUTION: 
   - DON'T delete any items from the Versions Table. Doing so would cause
   the loss of updates that should be shown in the app. When the final version
   of the app is released, this table will be hidden from view in the admin interface.
   - DON'T delete any items from the Categories Table. Modifying them is fine though.
